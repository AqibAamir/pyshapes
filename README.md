This code creates complex, colorful patterns using the turtle graphics library. It includes functions to draw basic shapes (squares, circles, stars, etc.), fractals (trees, Koch snowflakes), and L-systems. The main() function sets up the turtle, then calls these functions to generate various patterns on the screen. The final drawing includes grids, random lines, concentric circles, and more.
